# 🐍 Python built-ins
This library is re-write of python existing built-in ones
I wrote this library to improve my programming skills,
it isn't meant to be used as a replacement for the current
python built-in ones nor this is an attempt to reinvent the wheel.

> Python version `3.10`
### PURPOSE OF THIS LIBRARY
This library is meant to be studied to get
better understanding of the Python built-in ones.

### SOURCE BEHIND THE CODE

It was solely written based on the python built-in ones
execution output and in an attempt to closely resemble them.

* Note: it might not result same result in some rare cases.
* Note: this library doesn't contain all python built-in ones.

### THIS IS MY FIRST LIBRARY on GitHub
* Release Date: 22-Feb-2022; Tuesday

I'm currently in 1st semester at my university at the time of releasing this library. </br>


### Reason behind writing this library
As an Intermediate, I was curious to know the working of these built-in ones since </br>
I couldn't find anything useful and understandable on the web for what I was looking </br>
specifically, so I re-wrote this library to better understand them and discovered </br>
their various use cases and also the reason behind their unexpected output. </br>

### My experience while writing this library
It wasn't easy as anticipated things didn't go as planned </br>
somedays felt like there was no progress which paid off the next day. </br>
It exceeded my estimated time limit due to reforms, fixes, and improvements </br>
that had to be made during the process whenever encountered with new bugs or </br>
learned new concepts and also added the fact I wanted to make this library </br>
as perfect as much possible so any imperfections couldn't be left unattended. </br>

### CONCLUSION
Overall this was worth the time and effort. by doing all of that </br>
I could learn these concepts thoroughly and deeply which I wasn't aware </br>
of or didn't care about which improved and polished my programming skills. </br>
